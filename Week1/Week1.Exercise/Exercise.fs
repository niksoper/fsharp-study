module Exercise

    (* Notes

        The following exercise is split into two parts. The first has you reimplementing several library functions. The second deals with
        If it is necessary to make a function recursive, add change the declaration from let functionname to let rec functionname

        For any function that is marked with TODO, they have been given default values to reduce the numbers of errors in the incompelte state. 

        If you are having issues with producing the correct result, take a look at the signature file Exercise.fsi to see what your function signature is meant to look like 
        (Or hover over the function)

        When you have completed all of the functions, press f5 to run the full program!

        IF you have any questions, please send them over to Jason!

        Testing functions. Example: 
        Highlight the full definition of PrintList, right click, then press run in interactive.
        Now type:
        PrintList ["a"; "b"] ;; 
        to test

    //Part one: Reimplementing standard library functions

    // This is a hint and example that uses recursion, a cons pattern and a list pattern. Example from: Pattern Matching - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd547125.aspx

    //Note: Try not to look at other implementations and do from first principles! 
    //If you need examples to test, take a look at the msdn page
